# Recorded page previews

In a saved job’s **Details and records**, open **Application records** and select
**Create recorded preview** beside a saved page copy. The background task uses
the same progress and cancellation controls as page copying. The resulting
record offers a view selector, observed field labels, review messages and a
saved image for each available view. Selecting an image opens the existing
zoomable viewer.

The app checks that the source copy completed and belongs to the current job URL.
The worker checks the manifest against the saved inventory and starts the
checksum-bound replay browser. It saves the page and up to four directly captured
embedded frames. The frame caption uses the frame element’s label or title when
available. The worker checks the document and form schema after capture, keeps
missing resources and frame failures visible, and saves each image with a digest
in a new attempt record. The viewer checks that digest when loading an image.

This route reviews public archived content. It accepts a job and saved-record
identity, and uses only recorded resources. It preserves the job’s application
state. The current collector archives resources from its declared origin, so
uncollected cross-origin frames may appear unavailable. The synthetic
qualification supplies both origins and exercises their recorded frame path.
The next implementation work is permitted origin collection and connecting
fresh frame review to the contained candidate-entry workflow.

## Compiled Windows evidence, 2026-11-11

An owned app accepted a fictional saved archive with a parent page and a separate
frame, ran the normal preview endpoint and saved two images. The frame’s required
field appeared only in that frame’s outline. The history result and screenshot
API returned the recorded metadata and matching PNG digests. The private
`target/recorded-preview-qualification-uzbdlwz8/result.private.json` records the
API journey and drained process tree. Minimum sampled host availability was
28,728,381,440 bytes.

The compiled headless UI then opened the record, ran **Create recorded preview**,
selected **Qualifications** and loaded the frame image. The 1,360-pixel and
480-pixel viewport checks measured panel widths of 318 and 381 pixels, with the
image fitting each. The inspected screenshots and executable fingerprint are in
`target/recorded-preview-qualification-uzbdlwz8/`. Its `rendered.private.json`
binds the final result. The owned invocation took 40.418 seconds. The replay
reported four recorded responses and zero blocked requests for this fixture.

The initial rendered fixture omitted a required history timestamp. The next run
exposed a refresh race that discarded the open preview during completion. The
fixture now includes the timestamp, and the client waits for completion refresh
before showing the preview and preserves the rendered result for the same
attempt. A focused UI regression also checks that a response for a previous
selection cannot replace the current image and that mismatched digests refuse
rendering.

The Rust workspace passed 1,244 tests with 585 opt-in cases ignored across 43
targets. Clippy, formatting, source-copy, layout and image-viewer checks passed.
An existing worker contract test caught an extra null field on ordinary copy
requests. The optional field is now omitted when absent, preserving that wire
format, and both request variants reject candidate or credential fields. The
final UI refinement passed the focused script, managed build and compiled
browser checks. Logs are indexed by
`target/recorded-preview-verified-checks.private.json`.

The final host audit found zero matching development processes, services,
scheduled tasks, startup entries and resident models, with 33,285,652,480
physical bytes available. Automatic review blocked deletion of the copied test
runtimes and returned only “blocked by policy”. They remain in the private
qualification folder.
